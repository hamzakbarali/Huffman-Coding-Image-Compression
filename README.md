# Huffman-Coding-Image-Compression
In this project I have implemented the Huffman Coding Image Compression Algorithm in Java. The algorithm compresses the chosen image, decompresses it, and regenerates to its full quality.

Note: The GUI may not work properly in displaying the background picture. It is due to the path used in loading the picture which is related to the folder structure on my computer.
