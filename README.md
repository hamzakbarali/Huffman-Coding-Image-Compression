# Huffman-Coding-Image-Compression
In this project I have implemented the Huffman Coding Image Compression Algorithm in Java. The algorithm compresses the chosen image, decompresses it, and regenerates to its full quality.

Note: The GUI may not display the background picture I have chosen on your computer. It is due to the path used which is based on the folder structure on my computer.
